# MyPaw üêæ

**Talk to your pet to know what's best for them**

MyPaw is an AI-powered pet companion app that bridges the communication gap between pet owners and their furry friends. By combining advanced AI with pet-specific knowledge, MyPaw helps owners understand their pets' needs, behaviors, and health requirements.

## The Problem We're Solving

Over 50% of pet owners lack sufficient knowledge about their pet's welfare, nutrition, and behavior, often relying on outdated or conflicting information. This gap leads to improper feeding, delayed care, and preventable health issues, causing many rushed emergency vet visits. Nearly 43% of cats in the UK have not received recent veterinary care, reflecting owners' difficulty in recognizing needs.

MyPaw addresses this critical knowledge gap by enabling personalized, breed-specific communication and tailored diet plans, empowering owners to make informed decisions and improve pet health.

- **Smart Pet Identification**: Upload a photo to automatically identify your pet's breed and characteristics
- **Personalized Diet Plans**: Get weekly meal plans tailored to your pet's specific needs
- **PawMood: Mood Recognition Game**: Learn to read your pet's emotions through interactive scenarios
